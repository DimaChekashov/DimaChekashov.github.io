    "careerDescriptionOne": "In 2016, I became passionate about programming when I transferred from my first year of construction college to the \"Programming in Computer Systems\" program. While studying, I started my career as a markup developer at a local web studio, and after graduation and moving to Moscow, I transitioned into frontend development with React.",
    "careerDescriptionTwo": "After several years working with interfaces, I discovered backend development. For the first six months, I studied PHP and worked on integrations, but then I switched to Python. Since then, I've been building robust server-side solutions with Django and FastAPI for about four years.",

My journey through different layers of development gives me a holistic view of projects and helps me choose the best tools for each task.",

I also enjoy classical literature — my favorite author is Friedrich Maria Remarque. I study foreign languages: English (B2 level) and German (A2). I'm passionate about documentaries and films about outstanding people. My all-time favorite movies are \"Oppenheimer\" and \"The Man Who Knew Infinity\"."
